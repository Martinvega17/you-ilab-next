        "historyContent": "The You+i laboratory of IPICYT (Instituto Potosino de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica) was founded in 2013 with the objective of researching and developing technologies related to human-machine interaction. Its name comes from the combination of the word \"you\" which refers to the user and the letter \"i\" for interface, seeking to create a \"juxtaposition\" between humans and technology, through the design of intuitive and efficient interfaces that enhance the user experience. Since then, the laboratory has collaborated in various research and innovation projects in this field."
